Description : 

#For SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN and other statements returning resultset,
 mysql_query() returns a resource on success, or FALSE on error.

#For other type of SQL statements, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc,
 mysql_query() returns TRUE on success or FALSE on error.

#The returned result resource should be passed to mysql_fetch_array(), 
 and other functions for dealing with result tables, to access the returned data.

#Use mysql_num_rows() to find out how many rows were returned for a SELECT statement or 
 mysql_affected_rows() to find out how many rows were affected by a DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE, or UPDATE statement.

#mysql_query() will also fail and return FALSE if the user does not have permission to access the table(s) referenced by the query.
